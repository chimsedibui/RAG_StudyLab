        "### Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This code implements the proposition chunking method, based on [research from Tony Chen, et. al.](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2312.06648). The system break downs the input text into propositions that are atomic, factual, self-contained, and concise in nature, encodes the propositions into a vectorstore, which can be later used for retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Document Chunking:** Splitting a document into manageable pieces for analysis.\n",
        "2. **Proposition Generation:** Using LLMs to break down document chunks into factual, self-contained propositions.\n",
        "3. **Proposition Quality Check:** Evaluating generated propositions based on accuracy, clarity, completeness, and conciseness.\n",
        "4. **Embedding and Vector Store:** Embedding both propositions and larger chunks of the document into a vector store for efficient retrieval.\n",
        "5. **Retrieval and Comparison:** Testing the retrieval system with different query sizes and comparing results from the proposition-based model with the larger chunk-based model.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "The motivation behind the propositions chunking method is to build a system that breaks down a text document into concise, factual propositions for more granular and precise information retrieval. Using propositions allows for finer control and better handling of specific queries, particularly for extracting knowledge from detailed or complex texts. The comparison between using smaller proposition chunks and larger document chunks aims to evaluate the effectiveness of granular information retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method Details\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Loading Environment Variables:** The code begins by loading environment variables (e.g., API keys for the LLM service) to ensure that the system can access the necessary resources.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Document Chunking:**\n",
        "   - The input document is split into smaller pieces (chunks) using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. This ensures that each chunk is of manageable size for the LLM to process.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Proposition Generation:**\n",
        "   - Propositions are generated from each chunk using an LLM (in this case, \"llama-3.1-70b-versatile\"). The output is structured as a list of factual, self-contained statements that can be understood without additional context.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Quality Check:**\n",
        "   - A second LLM evaluates the quality of the propositions by scoring them on accuracy, clarity, completeness, and conciseness. Propositions that meet the required thresholds in all categories are retained.\n",
        "   \n",
        "5. **Embedding Propositions:**\n",
        "   - Propositions that pass the quality check are embedded into a vector store using the `OllamaEmbeddings` model. This allows for similarity-based retrieval of propositions when queries are made.\n",
        "   \n",
        "6. **Retrieval and Comparison:**\n",
        "   - Two retrieval systems are built: one using the proposition-based chunks and another using larger document chunks. Both are tested with several queries to compare their performance and the precision of the returned results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Granularity:** By breaking the document into small factual propositions, the system allows for highly specific retrieval, making it easier to extract precise answers from large or complex documents.\n",
        "- **Quality Assurance:** The use of a quality-checking LLM ensures that the generated propositions meet specific standards, improving the reliability of the retrieved information.\n",
        "- **Flexibility in Retrieval:** The comparison between proposition-based and larger chunk-based retrieval allows for evaluating the trade-offs between granularity and broader context in search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Proposition Generation:** The LLM is used in conjunction with a custom prompt to generate factual statements from the document chunks.\n",
        "2. **Quality Checking:** The generated propositions are passed through a grading system that evaluates accuracy, clarity, completeness, and conciseness.\n",
        "3. **Vector Store Integration:** Propositions are stored in a FAISS vector store after being embedded using a pre-trained embedding model, allowing for efficient similarity-based search and retrieval.\n",
        "4. **Query Testing:** Multiple test queries are made to the vector stores (proposition-based and larger chunks) to compare the retrieval performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "This code presents a robust method for breaking down a document into self-contained propositions using LLMs. The system performs a quality check on each proposition, embeds them in a vector store, and retrieves the most relevant information based on user queries. The ability to compare granular propositions against larger document chunks provides insight into which method yields more accurate or useful results for different types of queries. The approach emphasizes the importance of high-quality proposition generation and retrieval for precise information extraction from complex documents."
